This project was focused on evaluating bikeshare data available from Citibike for New York City rental bikeshare usage.  The outcome of this work will be used to evaluate the upcoming program for Des Moines, Iowa.  The main questions this will be used to answer who uses the system the most, impact of users vs subscribers, locations of top usages, and how often certain bikes are used.

## Various Graphing Analysis

This graph shows the number of trips by duration.  Through it, we can understand that the vast majority of our trips are under 20 minutes in duration and 99% are under an hour.  We can assume Des Moines will have a similar distribution of trips despite the location.  Trips may be slightly longer due to distance between locations however.

This shows similar data as above, however we have broken this down by gender.  We can see here that the majority of our customers are male and likely will stay that way in Des Moines.

This heatmap based on usage shows us that it is generally the commute times each day (8AM and 5PM) and on the working days of M-F.  This system may be slightly impacted by work from home, but would be good to track in more recent data.

This is a similar graph as above, but with a breakdown of Gender.  We once again can tell that the Males form the primary usage of our biking system.

The final heatmap shows that Male Subscribers are the backbone of our usage.  Converting users to subscribers is a key factor to increase usage. 

## Summary

In Conclusion, we can see that while bikesharing is overall popular in NYC, it is driven by mostly our male subscribers.  Additional graphs are also shown in the story to demonstrate bike usage and locations across NYC.  For further analysis, we should find a more comparable city in a midwestern state to better understand Des Moines future usages.
